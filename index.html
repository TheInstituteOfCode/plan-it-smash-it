          oversized towels with matching wardrobes (yes bring those Jimmy

          Your day will start with a gentle sunrise yoga class, a healthy
          breakfast followed by mindfulness meditation, the perfect start before
          a day of intense coursework.

          In the afternoon you can opt for either high-intensity training or
          dynamic yoga, depending on your needs.
      - text: >-
          We believe that preparing the mind to focus is really important, and
          if you’ve never tried yoga or meditation before you’ll go home with
          some really powerful skills.
